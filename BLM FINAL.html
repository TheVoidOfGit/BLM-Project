 invented a new way to dry-clean clothes in 1821.
 Even though people argued that slaves weren't allowed to own a patent for their inventions,
 Thomas was born a free man and became the first African American patent holder in the United States and was able to gain his inventions rights and profit from it.</h2></p>

 Blood plasma helps boost the a patient's blood volume,
 which can prevent shock, and can help treat blood clotting, so Drew's research into the storage,
 processing, and shipment of blood plasma helped save the lives of hundreds of people during World War II, 
and still after all this time it continues to save lives today. In 1941, Drew became the first director 
of the American Red Cross Blood Bank in New York. </h2></p>

 <center><p><h2>Garret Morgan was born in Kentucky in 1877 and was the first black man in Cleveland to own a car. When he was just 14 years old, he moved north to Ohio.
 Morgan worked on his mechanical skills and Then, in 1923,
He got the idea to add a third light as a warning instead of just having “Stop” and “Go.”He got the idea after he witnessed an accident at a corner, and got the idea:
 If he designed an automated signal with an interim “warning” position, 
then it would help prepare people to slow to a stop rather then a sudden stop. Unfortunatly now people use it as a race to see if they can beat the yellow light.
